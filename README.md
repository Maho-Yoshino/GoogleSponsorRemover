# Google Sponsor and AI overview remover
## Reason for development
This is a personal project, which was made due to my frustration, with Google's search engine, and their SEO bs.  
Why is it that i must see 8 sponsored links to get to actual content? Well now I (and possibly you!) won't have to!

Due to this, the extension is mainly built around removing (practically removing, technically just hiding) sponsored links and sponsored shopping sections in your Google searches.
## Installation
1. To go the [latest release](https://github.com/Maho-Yoshino/GoogleSponsorRemover/releases/latest) and download the source code
2. Unpack the folder to somewhere on your computer
3. Go to your browser's Extensions page
4. Enable Developer mode
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button, and click on the folder which contains the unpacked files
6. In the Extensions screen enable "Allow access to search page results" under "Google Sponsor remover", if it exists (this is nessecary for the extension to work)
